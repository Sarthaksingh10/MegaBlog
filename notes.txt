Environment:-
Environment depend on the type of out app whether we are creating it with the basic react app or with the 
help of vite cause to export the react app environment we need to write 
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL) in App.js file and then copy the url from console 
and if we create the react app through vite we will write "import.meta.env.vite_appwrite_url" instead of the above
and also we have to write vite instead of react app
